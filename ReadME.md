Orbit-Space is a Lofi music application designed to enhance focus, relaxation, and productivity. The goal was to create a scalable full-size app maintaining this Lofi ambiance integrated throughout and adaptable to different features.



## Key Features

- **Spotify Authentication**: Implemented NextAuth-based Spotify authentication to access the full music playlist and user management.

- **Customizable Backgrounds**: Users can select from some default live wallpaper options or upload their own, personalizing the visual experience to their liking.

- **User-Defined Playlists**: Users are not restricted to the default playlists. They can add their customized playlists.

- **Custom Themes**: There are four accessible custom themes: Nightowl, Countryside, Ghibli, and Cosy Home. By choosing them, the theme-based backgrounds, music effects, and internal Spotify playlists within the app will be updated.

- **Sound Effect Controls**: Users can control over the volume of each background sound effect, allowing them to create the perfect auditory environment. 

- **Interactive Cards**: Add-ons for users include random quotation cards and a real-time digital clock, these cards are draggable so that users can place them anywhere they wish to.
